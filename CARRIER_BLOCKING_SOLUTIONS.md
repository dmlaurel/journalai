# Carrier Blocking & Spam Filtering Solutions

## Issues Identified

1. **Friend 1 (7188010345)**: Calls show as "busy" with 0s duration - carrier is blocking before ringing
2. **Friend 2**: Call comes through but shows "SCAM likely" - carrier spam filtering

## Solutions

### Immediate Solutions

1. **Use a Toll-Free Number** (Best for reducing spam flags)
   - Toll-free numbers (800, 833, 844, 855, 866, 877, 888) have better reputation
   - More trusted by carriers and recipients
   - Purchase via Twilio Console: https://console.twilio.com

2. **Use a Local Number** (Better for specific area)
   - Get a number with the same area code as your target audience
   - Local numbers appear more legitimate

3. **Caller Name Registration (CNAM)**
   - Register a business name for your number
   - Shows your company/name instead of "Unknown" or just the number
   - Improves trust and reduces spam flags

### Long-term Solutions

1. **Build Phone Number Reputation**
   - Make legitimate calls consistently
   - Avoid spam-like patterns (too many calls to different numbers quickly)
   - Carriers track number behavior over time

2. **STIR/SHAKEN Compliance** (Automatic with Twilio)
   - Twilio numbers are automatically STIR/SHAKEN verified
   - This helps but doesn't prevent all blocking

3. **Contact Twilio Support**
   - They can help with carrier-specific issues
   - May have insights on number reputation for your specific number

### For Recipients

**Friend 1 (7188010345):**
- Check if their phone/carrier has call blocking enabled
- Ask them to add your number to contacts/whitelist
- Try a different time (some carriers have time-based filtering)

**Friend 2 ("SCAM likely"):**
- Ask them to save your number in contacts
- Answer the call once to "train" their carrier that it's legitimate
- Check phone settings for spam filtering options

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with different number types:
   ```bash
   # Current number might have reputation issues
   # Try purchasing a toll-free number and updating phone_number_id
   ```

2. Monitor call patterns:
   - Space out calls (avoid rapid-fire calling)
   - Consistent calling patterns help build reputation

3. Use the check script to monitor:
   ```bash
   python check_number_details.py +17188010345
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Consider purchasing a toll-free number for better delivery
2. Register caller name (CNAM) for the number
3. Build consistent calling patterns over time
4. For critical calls, ask recipients to save your number first
